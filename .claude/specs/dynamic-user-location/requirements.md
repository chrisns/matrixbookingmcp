# Requirements Document - Dynamic User Location

## Introduction

The Dynamic User Location feature eliminates the need for static location configuration through environment variables by dynamically retrieving user location preferences from the Matrix Booking API. This enhancement provides a more flexible and user-centric approach to location management, automatically fetching the user's current location settings from their profile at runtime via the `/api/v1/user/current?include=defaults` endpoint. The system intelligently handles scenarios where users have multiple location preferences, supporting users who work across different sites while ensuring location changes are immediately reflected without manual reconfiguration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Location Retrieval

**User Story:** As a Matrix Booking user, I want my location preferences to be automatically retrieved from my profile, so that I don't need to manually configure environment variables and my current location settings are always used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates any booking-related query THEN the system SHALL fetch the user's current location preferences from the Matrix Booking API endpoint `/api/v1/user/current?include=defaults`
2. IF the API call to retrieve user location is successful THEN the system SHALL extract and parse the location data from the response structure
3. WHEN the user profile contains location preferences THEN the system SHALL use these preferences for all subsequent booking operations in the current session
4. IF the API response includes multiple locations THEN the system SHALL support searching across all available locations simultaneously
5. WHEN location data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache it in memory for the duration of the user session with a configurable TTL (default: 5 minutes)

### Requirement 2: Multiple Location Handling

**User Story:** As a user with access to multiple locations, I want the system to intelligently handle my multiple location preferences, so that room bookings are made in the appropriate location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user profile contains multiple locations THEN the system SHALL identify all available locations from the API response
2. IF multiple locations are available AND no specific location is requested THEN the system SHALL search across all available locations
3. WHEN no default location is marked AND multiple locations exist THEN the system SHALL use the first location in the list or prompt the user to select a location
4. IF the user specifies a location in their query THEN the system SHALL validate it against the available locations from their profile
5. WHEN a specified location is not in the user's available locations THEN the system SHALL return an error message listing the valid locations
6. WHEN displaying search results from multiple locations THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which location each result belongs to

### Requirement 3: API Integration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the location retrieval to integrate seamlessly with the existing Matrix Booking API authentication, so that no additional configuration is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making the API call to `/api/v1/user/current?include=defaults` THEN the system SHALL use the existing authentication token from the current session
2. IF the API call fails due to authentication issues (401 Unauthorized) THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating authentication failure
3. WHEN the API endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff (maximum 3 retries)
4. IF all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide a descriptive error message with diagnostic information
5. WHEN the API response format changes or is unexpected THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the change and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 4: On-Demand Location Fetching

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user locations to be fetched on-demand rather than stored statically, so that location changes are immediately reflected without configuration updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a query requiring location context THEN the system SHALL fetch the location information in real-time
2. IF cached location data exists AND is within the TTL period (5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL use the cached data instead of making a new API call
3. WHEN the cache expires OR a user explicitly requests fresh data THEN the system SHALL fetch new location data from the API
4. IF multiple concurrent requests require location data THEN the system SHALL make only one API call and share the result (request deduplication)
5. WHEN fetching location on-demand THEN the system SHALL NOT store location data in environment variables or persistent storage

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle location retrieval failures gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback and can still use the system when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL return an error message stating "Unable to retrieve user location preferences" with connectivity troubleshooting steps
2. IF the user profile contains no location data THEN the system SHALL return an error advising the user to set a location preference in Matrix Booking
3. WHEN the API returns an unexpected response format THEN the system SHALL log the actual response structure for debugging and provide a user-friendly message
4. IF the API response doesn't contain expected location data THEN the system SHALL request manual location input from the user
5. WHEN any location-related error occurs THEN the system SHALL include actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the location retrieval to be fast and efficient, so that my booking queries are not delayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching location data from the API THEN the system SHALL complete the request within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
2. IF the API response time exceeds 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and return an appropriate error
3. WHEN location data is cached THEN the system SHALL retrieve it in less than 10 milliseconds
4. IF multiple concurrent requests require location data THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate API calls through request deduplication
5. WHEN system memory is constrained THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache eviction policies

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my location preferences to be handled securely, so that my personal information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location data is cached THEN the system SHALL store it only in memory and never persist to disk
2. IF logging location data THEN the system SHALL redact any personally identifiable information
3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL clear all cached location data from memory
4. IF location data contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL sanitize it before any error messages to end users
5. WHEN transmitting location data THEN the system SHALL use existing secure API channels (HTTPS)

### Requirement 8: User Experience and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about which location is being used for my searches, so that I can verify the correct context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a location is automatically selected THEN the system SHALL display which location is being used
2. IF the user wants to change the location for a specific query THEN the system SHALL provide a clear mechanism to do so
3. WHEN location retrieval is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading feedback
4. IF location retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages without exposing sensitive information
5. WHILE using a specific location THEN the system SHALL maintain this context throughout the user's query session

### Requirement 9: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want comprehensive logging of location retrieval operations, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during location retrieval THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate severity level and context
2. IF the API response structure is unexpected THEN the system SHALL log the actual response structure for debugging
3. WHEN multiple locations are available THEN the system SHALL log which location was selected and the selection logic used
4. IF cache is used THEN the system SHALL log cache hits and misses for performance monitoring
5. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed trace logs of the location resolution process

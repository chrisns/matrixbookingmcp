# Requirements Document - Matrix Booking MCP Server

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation in TypeScript that interfaces with the Matrix Booking API. The server will provide functionality to check room availability and book appointments through a REST API interface. The system will be stateless, secure, and well-tested with comprehensive API mocking capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Server Framework Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a TypeScript-based MCP server framework, so that I can provide Matrix Booking functionality through a standardized protocol interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is initialized THEN the system SHALL implement the official MCP protocol specification
2. WHEN TypeScript is used for development THEN the system SHALL include proper type definitions for all API interfaces
3. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL expose MCP-compliant endpoints for Matrix Booking operations
4. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters according to MCP standards
5. IF the MCP protocol requirements change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure credentials through environment variables, so that sensitive information is not stored in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a `.env` file
2. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL require `MATRIX_USERNAME`, `MATRIX_PASSWORD`, and `MATRIX_PREFERED_LOCATION`
3. IF any required environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with a descriptive error message
4. WHEN the `.env` file exists THEN the system SHALL NOT commit this file to version control
5. WHEN credentials are used THEN the system SHALL securely handle authentication tokens without logging sensitive data

### Requirement 3: Availability Checking Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to check room availability for specific dates and times, so that I can determine when rooms are free for booking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an availability check is requested THEN the system SHALL query the Matrix Booking API for room availability
2. IF no date is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the current date
3. IF no location is specified THEN the system SHALL use the `MATRIX_PREFERED_LOCATION` from environment variables
4. WHEN availability data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return room availability information in a structured format
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes
6. WHEN date/time parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate the format and range before making API calls

### Requirement 4: Appointment Booking Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to book appointments when rooms are available, so that I can reserve meeting spaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking request is made THEN the system SHALL use the POST method to the Matrix Booking API endpoint
2. WHEN booking data is sent THEN the system SHALL format the request body according to the Matrix Booking API specification
3. WHEN a booking is successful THEN the system SHALL return confirmation details including booking ID and time slots
4. IF a booking fails due to unavailability THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN booking parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL apply default values for date (today) and location (preferred location)
6. WHEN owner information is required THEN the system SHALL extract user details from the authenticated session

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want secure authentication handling, so that Matrix Booking credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use the credentials from environment variables
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
3. WHEN authentication tokens are received THEN the system SHALL handle them securely without persistent storage
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes (401/403)
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL NOT log passwords or authentication tokens

### Requirement 6: Stateless Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a stateless application design, so that the system is scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL NOT store any session or state information between requests
2. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN each request SHALL be processed independently
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL NOT require any persistent data recovery
4. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN multiple server instances SHALL operate without coordination
5. IF caching is considered THEN the system SHALL explicitly avoid any form of data caching

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage with API mocking, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage
2. WHEN API interactions are tested THEN the system SHALL use mock implementations of the Matrix Booking API
3. WHEN unit tests run THEN the system SHALL test each function and module independently
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL test the complete request/response flow
5. WHEN API responses are mocked THEN the system SHALL simulate both success and error scenarios
6. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL use realistic but anonymized booking data

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN API calls to Matrix Booking API fail THEN the system SHALL pass through the raw API error responses directly to the end user without modification or transformation
3. WHEN API operations exceed 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and return a timeout error
4. WHEN logging sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL exclude credentials and personal information
5. WHEN structured logging is used THEN the system SHALL include request IDs for traceability
6. WHEN Matrix Booking API returns error responses THEN the system SHALL NOT apply custom error message formatting

### Requirement 9: API Documentation and OpenAPI Specification

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear documentation and specifications, so that I can integrate with the MCP server effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN API endpoints are documented THEN the system SHALL include request/response examples
3. WHEN error responses are documented THEN the system SHALL specify all possible error codes and messages
4. WHEN authentication is documented THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the configuration requirements
5. WHEN the documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL serve it at a standard endpoint (e.g., `/docs`)

### Requirement 10: Development Workflow and Version Control

**User Story:** As a developer, I want semantic commits and proper version control practices, so that the development history is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are committed THEN the system development SHALL use semantic commit message format
2. WHEN features are implemented THEN each logical step SHALL be committed separately with descriptive messages
3. WHEN the repository is initialized THEN the system SHALL include appropriate `.gitignore` entries for TypeScript and Node.js
4. WHEN environment files exist THEN the system SHALL ensure `.env` files are excluded from version control
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use lock files to ensure reproducible builds

### Requirement 11: Data Validation and Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want robust input validation, so that the system is protected against invalid or malicious input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN date parameters are received THEN the system SHALL validate date formats and ranges
2. WHEN location parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate against allowed location values
3. WHEN time parameters are specified THEN the system SHALL ensure proper time zone handling
4. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize input to prevent injection attacks
5. WHEN API parameters are forwarded THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before making external calls

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a cancel booking capability to the Matrix Booking MCP server, allowing users to cancel existing bookings through a DELETE API call to the Matrix Booking system. The tool will provide comprehensive guidance and handle the cancellation process with proper notification settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want to cancel an existing booking by providing the booking ID, so that I can free up the reserved time slot and notify attendees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls the cancel-booking tool with a valid booking ID THEN the system SHALL make a DELETE request to https://app.matrixbooking.com/api/v1/booking/{bookingId}?notifyScope=ALL_ATTENDEES&sendNotifications=true
2. WHEN the cancellation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation message with the cancelled booking details
3. WHEN the booking ID is invalid or not found THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the booking could not be found
4. WHEN the user lacks permission to cancel the booking THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate authorization error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want clear guidance on how to use the cancel-booking tool, so that I understand what information is needed and what the tool will do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests tool guidance for cancel-booking THEN the system SHALL provide detailed instructions on how to find booking IDs
2. WHEN a user requests tool guidance THEN the system SHALL explain the notification behavior (ALL_ATTENDEES will be notified)
3. WHEN a user requests tool guidance THEN the system SHALL provide examples of successful cancellation scenarios
4. WHEN a user requests tool guidance THEN the system SHALL warn about the irreversible nature of booking cancellations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want the cancel-booking tool to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive helpful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Matrix API returns an error THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly error message with suggested next steps
2. WHEN there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL return a clear timeout or connection error message
3. WHEN the API returns an unexpected response format THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and provide debugging information
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on checking API credentials

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want the cancel-booking tool to validate inputs, so that I don't accidentally make invalid API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking ID is not provided THEN the system SHALL return a validation error requesting the booking ID
2. WHEN a booking ID is provided in an invalid format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with format requirements
3. WHEN all required parameters are valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with the cancellation request
4. WHEN optional parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them before making the API call

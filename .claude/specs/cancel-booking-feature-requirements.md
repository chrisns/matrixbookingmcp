# Cancel Booking Feature - Requirements Document

## Overview

This document defines the requirements for implementing a cancel booking feature in the Matrix Booking MCP server. The feature will allow users to cancel existing bookings through a dedicated MCP tool using the Matrix Booking API DELETE endpoint.

## Feature Scope

### Primary Objective
Implement a new MCP tool `matrix_booking_cancel_booking` that enables users to cancel their existing room and desk bookings with proper notification handling and error management.

### API Endpoint
The feature will integrate with the Matrix Booking API DELETE endpoint:
```
DELETE https://app.matrixbooking.com/api/v1/booking/{bookingId}?notifyScope=ALL_ATTENDEES&sendNotifications=true
```

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality

#### 1.1 Tool Interface
- **Tool Name**: `matrix_booking_cancel_booking`
- **Description**: Cancel an existing booking and optionally notify attendees
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `bookingId` (required): The booking ID to cancel
  - `notifyScope` (optional): Who to notify about the cancellation (default: "ALL_ATTENDEES")
  - `sendNotifications` (optional): Whether to send notifications (default: true)
  - `reason` (optional): Cancellation reason for audit trail

#### 1.2 Parameter Validation
- **bookingId**: Must be a valid integer or string representing a booking ID
- **notifyScope**: Must be one of: "ALL_ATTENDEES", "OWNER_ONLY", "NONE"
- **sendNotifications**: Must be boolean (true/false)
- **reason**: Optional string, maximum 500 characters

#### 1.3 User Workflow Integration
- Integrate with existing `get_user_bookings` tool for booking discovery
- Provide clear booking identification in success/error messages
- Support batch cancellation workflows through repeated calls

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

#### 2.1 Permission Requirements
- User must have permission to cancel the specific booking
- Booking owner can always cancel their bookings
- Administrative users may cancel any booking (if supported by API)
- Non-owners cannot cancel bookings they don't own

#### 2.2 Authentication Flow
- Use existing authentication patterns from codebase
- Leverage `AuthenticationManager` for credential management
- Follow same credential handling as other booking operations

### 3. Error Handling

#### 3.1 Standard Error Cases
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid booking ID format
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failure
- **403 Forbidden**: User lacks permission to cancel booking
- **404 Not Found**: Booking ID does not exist
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: API endpoint configuration issue
- **409 Conflict**: Booking already cancelled or cannot be cancelled
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Matrix API service issues

#### 3.2 Enhanced Error Context
Following the existing enhanced error handling pattern:
- Contextual error suggestions for each error type
- Alternative workflow recommendations
- Diagnostic steps for troubleshooting
- Related tool suggestions for error resolution

#### 3.3 Specific Cancel Booking Errors
- **Booking Already Cancelled**: Clear message with current booking status
- **Booking In Progress**: Cannot cancel bookings that have already started
- **Booking Past Due**: Handle cancellation of expired bookings
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Guide user to contact booking owner

### 4. Response Format

#### 4.1 Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bookingId": 12345,
  "status": "CANCELLED",
  "cancellationTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",

    "attendeeCount": 3,
    "owner": "john.doe@company.com"
  }
}
```

#### 4.2 Error Response
Following existing enhanced error format with cancel-specific suggestions:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Booking not found or already cancelled",
    "code": "BOOKING_NOT_FOUND",
    "httpStatus": 404,
    "context": "cancel_booking",
    "tool": "matrix_booking_cancel_booking"
  },
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "action": "Verify booking exists",
      "tool": "get_user_bookings",
      "description": "Check your current bookings to verify the booking ID"
    }
  ],
  "relatedWorkflows": ["Booking management and verification"],
  "troubleshooting": {
    "commonCauses": [
      "Booking ID does not exist",
      "Booking already cancelled",
      "Incorrect booking ID format"
    ],
    "diagnosticSteps": [
      "1. Use get_user_bookings to list your current bookings",
      "2. Verify the booking ID is correct",
      "3. Check if booking was already cancelled"

# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement organization context resolution system
  - Create `src/services/organization-context-resolver.ts` with validation and fallback logic
  - Add TypeScript interfaces and configuration support with environment variables
  - Implement caching with TTL for organization validation results
  - Create comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios and edge cases
  - _Requirements: R1_

- [x] 2. Fix core service layer organization ID handling
  - Update OrganizationService to prevent NaN errors and integrate context resolver
  - Fix AvailabilityService date validation to allow identical start/end times
  - Update LocationService to fix empty hierarchy results with proper organization context
  - Update SearchService to handle organization ID resolution in search queries
  - _Requirements: R1, R2, R3_

  - Integrate organization context resolver into all MCP method handlers
  - Fix health check implementation and add missing MCP protocol methods
  - Add consistent error handling and logging across all endpoints
  - Ensure all booking and search operations use resolved organization context
  - _Requirements: R1, R2, R3, R4_

- [x] 4. Create comprehensive test coverage
  - Build integration tests for end-to-end desk and room booking flows
  - Update all existing unit tests to work with organization context changes
  - Add performance tests for organization context resolution and caching
  - Test cross-organization scenarios and error recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: R1, R2, R3_

- [x] 5. Deploy with monitoring and documentation
  - Update documentation with new configuration options and troubleshooting guides
  - Add monitoring dashboard and metrics for organization context operations
  - Deploy to staging for validation, then production with gradual rollout
  - Monitor booking success rates and system health during deployment
  - _Requirements: R1, R2, R3, R4_
